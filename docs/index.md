The sample dataset contains 53 features for each patent and the full dataset contains 63 features. These features include author, team size, country of inventor, category of patent, etc.  In the preprocessing step, our aim is to remove redundancies, transform various data types to processable numbers and save them into matrices. Details about how we deal with each features are in the Data Preprocessing.pdf.

For example, we deleted features where over 40% were NAN values. For company names and author names, we assign them to unique indices, respectively. The figure below shows the processing of the first 20 features.

The granting time is approval date minus application date. We save granting time in both days (for regression) and years (for classification).

Firstly, we tried to test the correlation between the granting time and the features that we used. Since the Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) does quite well in finding the linear combination of features to model the difference between different classes, we applied the LDA to our data and made a 2D plot for the first two components of LDA.

We first tried LDA on 100 samples and repeated it several times. From the results, we can observe rough clusters, though some classes sometimes may overlap.

Then, we tried to apply LDA on larger subsets. We noticed that using years as classes may not be very ideal because 364 days and 366 days, for example, are very close to each other, but would be classified into different classes. Therefore, we tried to do experiments using both days as labels and years (1-6) as labels. 

The figures below are our results: The left two are results based on 10000 samples and the right two are based on 1000 samples. 

The upper figures uses granting days as labels. A lighter color indicates a shorter granting days and a darker color indicates a longer days.

The lower figures uses granting years (1,2,â€¦,6 years) as labels and the darker color indicates the shorter years.

From the results, we can see that samples of shorter and longer granting time are separated after using LDA to some extent, though not that clearly. Especially for those samples in the middle, LDA did not bring an ideal classification. The reason may be that the correlation between features and grant time is not very strong, or that the relationship between them is more complicated (more than linearly) and therefore more sophisticated models are required to detect it.

Besides, we tried to test if a non-linear combination of features can explain the granting time. We applied TSNE on 1000 samples and made 2D plot of first two components. The result is still not ideal.
