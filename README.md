# ML Patent Study

## Introduction/Background

Analyzing intellectual property data using machine learning methods are gaining popularity in recent years. Trends and relationships in patent databases are mined and applied to knowledge management, technology management, economic value, and extraction and management of information[1]. 
Our objective is to build a model that will take in information of a patent (filing date, inventor’s country, team size, category, etc.), and predict its granting time. This model will complement Dr. Ramachandran’s study on grants delay’s effect on inventors’ motivations. Previous works[3][4] mainly used statistics and data science methods such as time series analysis, entity recognition, and relation extraction. We hope to improve the prediction quality by applying deep neural networks on various input features.
